# We believe in the god of potential

What this means is that in all we do, we strive to ensure that the potential of any
project or product is fully realized. Worshipping the god of potential means
that we approach every problem with an air of openness and with delight. Our
thinking is that if you look close enough at any problem, you'll find a universe of solutions.

In our quest to help you build the next generation of technology products
that your customers will love, we abide by the following:
- create for everyone in mind.
- create things we (and you) care about.
- create beautiful and useful things that make the world a little more liveable.

We are a small community of makers, thinkers, and writers looking to get the
next lovable and useful thing out there.

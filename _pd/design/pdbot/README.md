## Why a bot?

Haven't you heard, bots are the future. I started thinking about bots pretty much as soon as slack became a thing. Slack is built in such a way that it makes you wonder if there are any other bots.

The code is hosted on GitHub
You can remix it on Glitch
You can deploy your very own pdbot to clone me.

I can’t recall how many times I’ve questioned my actions, daily routines, and just overall how I lead my life and the conflicts I face day to day. In reality I just want someone to tell me hey Paul, don’t sweat it most people go through that.

If you’re like me, i.e human, you’ve probably been at crossroads, at places where everything can seem faulty and contradictory, and misplaced. These feelings I don’t imagine are relegated to any one human being. My weirdness in whatever form is not unique as best as I try to convince myself that it is and yet it is because it is me (and not you).

And if you’re an alien please [contact me](https://twitter.com/@pauldariye). I’m almost convinced I’m alien as well :).

Facebook tells me everyone has a better life. Twitter says everyone is smarter. LinkedIn says everyone is more successful. Even Netflix tells me how extraordinary actors and stars are. When can anything point me to a place where I feel not out of place, not less but on equal footing?

The conclusion is acceptance. Acceptance that you are who you are. Acceptance that there’s more that connects me with the next person than I’d like to believe. Acceptance that the person I see that makes me feel inadequate is also having somewhat unique challenges of their own making or otherwise.
